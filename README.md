## CSC 212 Final Project: Sorting Algorithms

This visualizer program was made using C++ and SFML library.

**STEPS TO RUN PROGRAM:**

**Without IDE:**

Just download and run the executable play file.

**With IDE:**

1. Clone Repository
2. Locate and open folder in IDE
3. Add or link SFML include and lib folders
4. Open terminal in IDE
5. Type the command `make game`
6. Run using `./play`

**What program has to offer:**

There are 5 sorting algorithms you can visualize in this program.

**To Run:**

Hit 0 for New Vector 

Hit 1 for Bubble Sort

Hit 2 for Insertion Sort

Hit 3 for Merge Sort

Hit 4 for Quick Sort

Hit 5 for Selection Sort

**Note: ALLOW PROGRAM TO FINISH SORT EXECUTION BEFORE CALLING NEW ACTION**

### Sorting Algorithm Benchmarking

1. Clone the repository
2. Compile all .cpp files in the `Benchmarking` folder with `g++ main.cpp sort.cpp -o main`.
3. Run the executable with `./main`.
4. Choose the sequence (sorted, random, reversed or partially sorted) you want, and a .csv file (with runtime for all sorting algorithms versus various input sizes) will be created in your current directory :)
